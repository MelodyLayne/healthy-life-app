# My Healthy Life App

### Concept -
It's not a novel idea to build an app for better diet and exercise but being a Type 1 Diabetic, it's something important to me. I figured why not take the opportunity to accomplish 2 things at once.

### Tech Stack -
 - NextJS(Pages Router),
 - GraphQL for API routes,
 - MongoDB for data storage.
 - Python for data processing

So what is it going to do? I'm glad you asked!

### MVP -
My current MVP's are that a user can do 3 things:

 - Track dietary intakes against set goals

 - Input fitness goals and get help generating a customized workout plan(this will be the grand python implementation)

 - Utilize a built in calendar view to plan and update both daily exercise and dietary activities

### Stretch Goals -
For "Stretch Goals" there are two:

 - Access the Spotify API to allow users to control music during their workout

 - Explore the ability to integrate with Android and Apple devices to get real time activity data
